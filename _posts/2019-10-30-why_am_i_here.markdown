Why am I enrolled in Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp in partnership for the first time with UC Irvine? 
What forces brought me to this place?

To really answer that question, we need to go back to my senior year of high school when I was deciding what and where I wanted to study for college.
At that time, like most 17-year old people, I really didn't know what I wanted to do for a career so I went with what I thought would be a personally satisfying career in Computer Art - maybe photography, maybe 3D modeling/animation, or maybe graphic design. At that time, I didn't even know what computer science even referred to.

Two years into college I happened to take an Intro to Programming course and I realized that not only was this really interesting, but I had a knack for it. I didn’t feel strongly enough to change my major but I did do everything I could to earn a computer science minor. I ended up falling short by a few credits.

A few years later I realized I wasn’t making the money I knew I was capable of earning, but I also wasn’t willing to take on more debt to go back to school. It was at this point in time that I started working on the free online coding courses offered by flatiron with a goal of completing a complex and independent project. If I could reach that goal, I would be able to go to any employer and convince them of my value as an employee. I did make significant progress at this time learning JavaScript, ruby, html, and css. However, I never completed an independent project that showcased my abilities and I didn’t feel completely confident in my ability to sell myself to an employer.

By chance, I did end up finding myself work in a software related role (I did not apply for this role, I was not hired for this role, but an opportunity arose and I accepted the offer). I work as a PLC controls technician working in warehouses programming automated conveyor systems. I don't program projects from scratch but I do upload a project to the controller in the field, test, and edit the program as I troubleshoot electrical and logical issues. 

After a period of time in this industry I have found myself financially stable enough to take on more debt, and more prepared to succeed in a software engineering bootcamp. I honestly don't remember why I chose to make the jump at the time that I did or why I chose flatiron, other than I worked with flatiron in the past, and they're high advertised job placement rate sounded really appealing. Within a week of the idea crossing my mind I was enrolled for the program starting as soon as possible.

My goal is to find a job that pays at least $13k/yr more (maybe a lot more) in the bay area where I'm currently living, so that I can pay off my loan within a year.

In conclusion, I'm here because I find the puzzle solving dynamic of the work interesting and I'm career driven for more money.
